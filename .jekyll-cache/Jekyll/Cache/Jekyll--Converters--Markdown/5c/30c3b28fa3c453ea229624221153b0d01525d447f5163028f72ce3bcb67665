I"˜<h1 id="make-your-own-jekyll-website-for-your-academic-research-group">Make your own Jekyll website for your academic research group</h1>

<p>This website is powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and uses some <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> and  <a href="http://www.bootswatch.com">Bootswatch</a>. The page borrows open source code from <a href="https://github.com/allanlab/allanlab/">Allan Lab</a>. The site is simple yet adaptable.</p>

<p>All pages are written in markdown for easy editing, and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> uses Liquid for the data-driven pages. The publication list is automatically generated from bibtex, and requires the jekyll-scholar plugin. The news items, and group members are stored as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.yml</code> data sheets (plain text) in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_data folder</code>, so that one can update the website easily. The pages are in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_pages</code> folder. Updating and maintaining is easy using <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> (not worldpress-easy, but there are other advantages (see e.g. <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/">this</a>, or <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2015/11/jekyll-against-the-rest-of-the-world/">this</a>). <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> takes all the markdown and data files, and creates beautiful <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code> folder.</p>

<p>Create and open a github account, go to <a href="https://github.com/lahtilab/lahtilab.github.io">our repository</a>, and click â€˜forkâ€™. This is now your copy of the website, and you can change and adapt it. Then change the name of the repository to â€œyour_usernameâ€ and the name of the branch to â€œgh-pagesâ€.  Your website is now automatically published under <em>your_username.github.io/your_username/</em>. Except that it probably still looks like our website.</p>

<p>To modify the webpage, you can either do everything on on github.com (go to a file, click â€œeditâ€, then â€œcommitâ€, â€œpushâ€), or install  <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> on your computer and play with your local copy that you sync with the branch on github.com.  The former is much easier in the beginning, but a bit less convenient once you start rewriting everythint. To get it to work on your computer (and to learn a bit more about <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>), <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/">here</a> and <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-jekyll-plus-a-free-bootstrap-3-starter-theme">here</a> are tutorials on how to use it and how set it up locally. Also, consider using the <a href="http://www.desktop.github.com">Github desktop app</a>.</p>

<p>Now letâ€™s make this <em>your</em> website.</p>

<p>First, go to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">news.ylm</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">publist.ylm</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">team.ylm</code> files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_data</code> folder and insert your own data into the data fields. Watch out:  <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> is quite strict about extra or missing spaces etc. Adhere to the format. In the beginning, test each change: commit, push, and check the published website.</p>

<p>For publications, you can add a â€œ1â€ in the highlight field, then it will be featured prominently. You can add important  news items (red, â€œnews1â€), and less important  news items (blue, â€œnews2â€).</p>

<p>For the news items, just keep adding them. The first 10 will be displayed on the â€˜homeâ€™ page.</p>

<p>For the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">team.ylm</code> file</p>

<p>Next, change the content of all files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_pages</code> folder.  To change the title in the homepage, go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">homelay.html</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_layout</code> folder.</p>

<p>Lastly, change the footer and perhaps header appropriately (in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_include</code>).</p>

<p>You might also want to change the style or theme. I imported style files (in sass) from Bootstrap/Bootwatch, you can replace them with your own (in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_sass directory</code>). For small changes, just work on the override stuff in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.sass</code> file in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CSS</code> folder. Or change some variables in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_variables.sass</code> file, like the background color etc.</p>

<p>As said, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> takes all the markdown and data files, and creates beautiful <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code> folder.In the end, either upload these files  to your server, or buy yourself a domain and check the instructions on github on how to host it there.</p>
